Design a binary classifier to detect if given sample is adulterated or not.

Problem statement:

You are given with data of different milk samples' spectrum. The spectrum ranges from 1831 cm-1 to 939 cm-1.

The milk samples have different fat percentages. For each fat percentage milk sample, varying quantity of adulterant is added.

Adulterants used are Urea, Sucrose, Starch, Neutralizer, Maltose, Maltodextrin, Glucose, Fructose, Formalin, Detergent, Ammonium Sulphate and Added Water.

For this given data, design a binary classifier that distinguishes Unadulterated Milk Samples from Adulterated one.
